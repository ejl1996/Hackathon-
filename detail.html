        <div class="detail-image"></div>
        <p class="detail-textBody">In today’s complex and evolving business environment with hundreds of different
            communication tools, fully or partially
            remote teams, and even multicultural teams spanning multiple zones, effective communication has never been
            more important —or more challenging. A leader’s ability to communicate clearly and effectively
            </br>
            </br>
        <h3>1. Be clear and concise</h3>
        <p class="detail-textBody">Communication is primarily about word choice. And when it comes to word choice, less
            is more.
            The key to powerful and persuasive communication—whether written or spoken—is clarity and, when possible,
            brevity.
            Before engaging in any form of communication, define your goals and your audience.
            Outlining carefully and explicitly what you want to convey and why will help ensure that you include all
            necessary
            information. It will also help you eliminate irrelevant details.
            Avoid unnecessary words and overly flowery language, which can distract from your message.
            And while repetition may be necessary in some cases, be sure to use it carefully and sparingly. Repeating
            your
            message
            can ensure that your audience receives it, but too much repetition can cause them to tune you out entirely.
            </br>
            </br>
        <h3>2. Prepare ahead of time</h3>
        <p class="detail-textBody">Know what you are going to say and how you are going to say before you begin any type
            of communication.
            However, being prepared means more than just practicing a presentation.
            Preparation also involves thinking about the entirety of the communication, from start to finish. Research
            the
            information you may need to support your message. Consider how you will respond to questions and criticisms.
            Try
            to
            anticipate the unexpected.
            Before a performance review, for instance, prepare a list of concrete examples of your employee’s behavior
            to
            support
            your evaluation.
            Before engaging in a salary or promotion negotiation, know exactly what you want. Be ready to discuss ranges
            and
            potential compromises; know what you are willing to accept and what you aren’t. And have on hand specific
            details to
            support your case, such as relevant salaries for your position and your location (but be sure that your
            research
            is
            based on publicly available information, not company gossip or anecdotal evidence).
            </br>
            </br>
        <h3>3. Be mindful of nonverbal communication</h3>
        <p class="detail-textBody">Our facial expressions, gestures, and body language can, and often do, say more than
            our words.
            Nonverbal cues can have between 65 and 93 percent more impact than the spoken word. And we are more likely
            to
            believe
            the nonverbal signals over spoken words if the two are in disagreement.
            Leaders must be especially adept at reading nonverbal cues.
            Employees who may be unwilling to voice disagreements or concerns, for instance, may show their discomfort
            through
            crossed arms or an unwillingness to make eye contact. If you are aware of others’ body language, you may be
            able
            to
            adjust your communication tactics appropriately.
            </br>
            </br>
        <h3>4. Watch your tone</h3>
        <p class="detail-textBody">How you say something can be just as important as what you say. As with other
            nonverbal cues, your tone can add
            power
            and emphasis to your message, or it can undermine it entirely.
            Tone can be an especially important factor in workplace disagreements and conflict. A well-chosen word with
            a
            positive
            connotation creates good will and trust. A poorly chosen word with unclear or negative connotations can
            quickly
            lead to
            misunderstanding.
            When speaking, tone includes volume, projection, and intonation as well as word choice. In real time, it can
            be
            challenging to control tone to ensure that it matches your intent. But being mindful of your tone will
            enable
            you to
            alter it appropriately if a communication seems to be going in the wrong direction.
            Tone can be easier to control when writing. Be sure to read your communication once, even twice, while
            thinking
            about
            tone as well as message. You may even want to read it out loud or ask a trusted colleague to read it over,
            if
            doing so
            does not breach confidentiality.
            </br>
            </br>
        <h3>5. Practice active listening</h3>
        <p class="detail-textBody">Communication nearly always involves two or more individuals.
            Therefore, listening is just as important as speaking when it comes to communicating successfully. But
            listening
            can be
            more challenging than we realize.
            In her blog post Mastering the Basics of Communication, communication expert Marjorie North notes that we
            only
            hear
            about half of what the other person says during any given conversation.
            The goal of active listening is to ensure that you hear not just the words the person is saying, but the
            entire
            message.
            Some tips for active listening include:
            -Giving the speaker your full and undivided attention
            -Clearing your mind of distractions, judgements, and counter-arguments.
            -Avoiding the temptation to interrupt with your own thoughts.
            -Showing open, positive body language to keep your mind focused and to show the speaker that you are really
            listening.
            -Rephrase or paraphrase what you’ve heard when making your reply.
            -Ask open ended questions designed to elicit additional information.
            </br>
            </br>
        <h3>6. Build your emotional intelligence</h3>
        <p class="detail-textBody">Communication is built upon a foundation of emotional intelligence. Simply put, you
            cannot communicate
            effectively with
            others until you can assess and understand your own feelings.
            “If you’re aware of your own emotions and the behaviors they trigger, you can begin to manage these emotions
            and
            behaviors,” says Margaret Andrews in her post, How to Improve Your Emotional Intelligence.
            Leaders with a high level of emotional intelligence will naturally find it easier to engage in active
            listening,
            maintain appropriate tone, and use positive body language, for example.
            Understanding and managing your own emotions is only part of emotional intelligence. The other part—equally
            important
            for effective communication—is empathy for others.
            /br>

            </br>
        <h3>7. Develop a workplace communication strategy</h3>
        <p class="detail-textBody">Today’s workplace is a constant flow of information across a wide variety of formats.
            Every single communication
            must be
            understood in the context of that larger flow of information.
            Even the most effective communicator may find it difficult to get their message across without a workplace
            communication
            strategy.
            A communication strategy is the framework within which your business conveys and receives information. It
            can—and
            should—outline how and what you communicate to customers and clients, stakeholders, and managers and
            employees.
            Starting most broadly, your strategy should incorporate who gets what message and when. This ensures that
            everyone
            receives the correct information at the right time.
            It can be as detailed as how you communicate, including defining the type of tools you use for which
            information. For
            example, you may define when it’s appropriate to use a group chat for the entire team or organization or
            when a
            meeting
            should have been summarized in an email instead.
            </br>
            </br>
        <h3>8. Create a positive organizational culture</h3>
        <p class="detail-textBody">The corporate culture in which you are communicating also plays a vital role in
            effective communication.
            In a positive work environment—one founded on transparency, trust, empathy, and open dialogue—communication
            in
            general
            will be easier and more effective.
            Employees will be more receptive to hearing their manager’s message if they trust that manager. And managers
            will find
            it easier to create buy-in and even offer constructive criticism if they encourage their employees to speak
            up,
            offer
            suggestions, and even offer constructive criticisms of their own.
            “The most dangerous organization is a silent one,” says Lorne Rubis in a blog post, Six Tips for Building a
            Better
            Workplace Culture. Communication, in both directions, can only be effective in a culture that is built on
            trust
            and a
            foundation of psychological safety.
            Authoritative managers who refuse to share information, aren’t open to suggestions, and refuse to admit
            mistakes
            and
            accept criticism are likely to find their suggestions and criticisms met with defensiveness or even ignored
            altogether.
